      <h1>Places I Have Been and Would Like to Go</h>

      <h2>Travel Theme: Beach Vacations</h2>
      <p> <font size="4"> While I enjoy travel accross the globe, one of my favorite types of travel are relaxing beach vacations. This page explores some of my most recent travel and some of my dream beach vacations. I am someone who enjoys 85 degree weather and constant sun, even the humidity! </font></p>


      <h2>My Dream Travel Destination: Maldives</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p> <font size="4">A chain of islands southwest of India and Sri Lanka, the Maldives seems like the perfect destination. Warm and with water as clear as the eye can see. On my next trip to India, I will definitely make a stop to the Maldives. </font></p>

      <h2>My Winter 2015 Vacation: Cabo</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p> <font size="4"> A great week starting from the day after Christmas until New Years in Cabo. Although a warm destination, I was surprised that the weather never made it above low 70s. Still a great time with a large group of family and friends. I would definitely go back, but maybe during a warmer month. </font></p>
